# ralph-cli

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/ralph-cli.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/ralph-cli)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/allegro/ralph-cli/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/allegro/ralph-cli?branch=develop)

A command-line interface for Ralph.

`ralph-cli` uses [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for
managing its dependencies, so assuming that you already have it
installed on your system, all you have to do is `glide install` and
then `go build` (or `go install`).

BTW, this repo should be considered as "work in progress", so stay tuned!

## Relation to "beast" (old ralph-cli)

This repo used to be inhabited by `beast` - an older version of Ralph's
API command-line client, written in Python. It is no longer maintained,
but you can still find its code on the `beast` branch.
