To install just type:

  curl https://raw.github.com/vi4m/beast/master/install.sh | sh -


You need to create ~/.beast/config file like this:


username="ralph_username"                                                                                       
api_key="478457f9f32323201ebde8ef79cd9d3a028ced56747"
url="https://ralph.url.com"

That's it.

Type `~/beast export dev`
